            <h1>My Favourite Singers</h1>
            <p>
                This simple website is about four singers that I really enjoy listening to:
                Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and Zayn Malik. Each one has
                a unique style, voice, and story.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use the navigation bar at the top to visit each singer’s page.
                On every page, you will find a short introduction, a few popular songs,
                and a simple description of why many people enjoy their music.
